Step 1: Install XAMPP

    Download XAMPP:
        Go to the official XAMPP website and download the version suitable for your operating system.
    Install XAMPP:
        Run the installer and follow the setup instructions. Select components like Apache, MySQL, PHP, etc., as needed.

Step 2: Start XAMPP

    Launch XAMPP:
        Open XAMPP Control Panel.
    Start Apache and MySQL:
        Click the Start buttons next to Apache and MySQL modules.

Step 3: Clone the Project from GitHub

    Open Git Bash or Terminal:
        Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project. The default XAMPP directory for hosting projects is usually:

        makefile

    C:\xampp\htdocs

Clone the Repository:

    Use the following command to clone the repository:

    bash

        git clone <your-github-link>

        Replace <your-github-link> with the actual GitHub repository link.

Step 4: Move the Project to htdocs

    Locate the Project:
        After cloning, the project will be in the folder where you ran the git clone command. Move the project folder to the htdocs folder inside your XAMPP installation directory:

    makefile

    C:\xampp\htdocs\your-project-name

Step 5: Set Up the Database (If Required)

    Open phpMyAdmin:
        Go to your browser and type http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
    Import the Database:
        If your project has an SQL file, go to the Import tab in phpMyAdmin and upload the .sql file provided in your project.

Step 6: Configure the Project (Optional)

    Update Database Configuration:
        Go to your project folder (in htdocs), open the configuration file (like config.php or .env), and update the database credentials as needed:

        php

        $servername = "localhost";
        $username = "root";
        $password = "";
        $dbname = "your-database-name";

Step 7: Run the Project

    Access Your Project in the Browser:
        Open your browser and type http://localhost/your-project-name.
    Project Running:
        If everything is set up correctly, the project should load and run.

Step 8: Debug (If Needed)

    Check for Errors: If something is not working, check the PHP error logs or XAMPP logs located in xampp/logs/php_error_log.

That's it! You should now be able to run your PHP project successfully.
